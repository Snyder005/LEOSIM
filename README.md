# LEOSIM

Simulation of low earth orbit satellite streaks in astronomical images including: 

* Generate realistic satellite surface brightness profiles based on satellite geometry, orbit parameters, telescope properties, and atmosphere.

* Simulate satellite streaks (masked or unmasked) in coadd images for use in testing noise correlations and bogus source detections.

## Dependencies

The LEOSim module is being developed concurrently to use the latest version of the LSST Science Pipeline DM Stack.  For information on how to install the LSST Science Pipeline, visit: <https://pipelines.lsst.io/>.

Additionally the LEOSim module requires the installtion of `rubin-sim` package and the data download. For installation instructions, visit: <https://github.com/lsst/rubin_sim>.
