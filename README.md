# LEOSIM

Simulation of low earth orbit satellite streaks in astronomical images including: 

* Generate realistic satellite surface brightness profiles based on satellite geometry, orbit parameters, telescope properties, and atmosphere.

* Simulate satellite streaks (masked or unmasked) in coadd images for use in testing noise correlations and bogus source detections.

## Dependencies

The SatSim module is being developed concurrently to use the latest version of the LSST Science Pipeline DM Stack, and should require no additional dependencies or modules outside of those include in `lsst_distrib` selection of packages in the DM Stack setup.  For information on how to install the LSST Science Pipeline, visit: <https://pipelines.lsst.io/>
